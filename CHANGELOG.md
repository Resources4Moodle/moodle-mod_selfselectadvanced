# Changelog

## 1.0.1 (2026-07-24)

- Notification templates: every message now receives the recipient
  placeholders `{$a->firstname}`, `{$a->lastname}`, `{$a->fullname}`
  and `{$a->url}`, enabling full personalisation through Moodle's
  Language customisation. Invitations additionally expose
  `{$a->expirynote}` and the invitation body was rewritten to address
  the invitee by name, state the expiry date and explain the
  forming-vs-frozen change rules.

## 1.0.0 (2026-07-24)

First stable release. Complete implementation of the binding
specification: invitation-only group formation with reserved seats and
acceptance cascades; five override-resolved numeric limits with
position displays and reasons; leadership succession; guide review
with load limits; plugin-local participant attributes with admin CSV
ingest; prioritised composition quotas with a live deficiency panel;
the central override subsystem (P1–P16 precedence, fully tested);
transactional jointly-validated staged moves; the per-group penalty
ledger and cumulative gradebook integration; freeze/unfreeze with
snapshots, drift reporting and bulk operations; deterministic
auto-grouping with rule relaxation; flagged reports; events,
messaging, scheduled tasks, privacy API and backup/restore.
Built slice-by-slice with per-slice PHPUnit + Behat gates on both
MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL (audit trail in docs/audits/).
